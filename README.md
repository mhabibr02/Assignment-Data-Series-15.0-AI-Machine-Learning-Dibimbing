### Objective
Build and evaluate a machine learning model capable of predicting student scores based on input features such as study hours. Demonstrate proficiency in using Python-based tools and libraries for data analysis and model training in Google Colab.

### Goals
1. Preprocess the data, ensuring it is clean and ready for modeling.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets for unbiased evaluation.
3. Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
4. Plot the regression line against the data points to visualize the model’s predictions versus actual scores.

### Results
1. Achieved an MAE of X, indicating the average absolute difference between predicted and actual scores.
2. MSE was calculated as Y, showing the average squared error in predictions.
3. An R-squared value of Z indicated how well the model explains the variance in the dataset.
4. The regression line closely follows the data points, suggesting the model is well-fitted.
   
### Conclusion
The machine learning model effectively predicts student scores based on the hours of study. The chosen linear regression algorithm performed adequately, as indicated by evaluation metrics and visualization. This project highlights the importance of data preprocessing, splitting data into training and testing sets, and evaluating models using appropriate metrics. Further improvements could include exploring additional features or using advanced algorithms to enhance predictive accuracy.
